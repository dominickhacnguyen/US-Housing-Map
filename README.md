# US-map5
CSCE 120 Final Project

My team and I were tasked to create an interactive infographic for the final project of our web development course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Inspired by the heads up display from the Iron Man movies, we set out to develop a dynamic interative map that displays housing information visually through charts and graphs.

Using libraries including D3.js, canvas.js, Bootstrap, and jQuery, we were able to create a US map that allows the user to see information about each state by simply hovering over the state.
