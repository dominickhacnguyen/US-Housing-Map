# US Housing Data Visualization
CSCE 120 Final Project
Dec 2016

My team and I were tasked to create an interactive infographic for the final project of our web development course at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

Inspired by the heads up display from the Iron Man movies, we set out to develop a dynamic interative map that displays housing information visually through charts and graphs.

Using libraries including D3.js, canvas.js, Bootstrap, and jQuery, we were able to create a US map that allows the user to see information about each state in real time by simply hovering over the state.

By selecting the category from the drop down menu, the map automatically changes the color darkness of each state to display each state's relative value to that category.
